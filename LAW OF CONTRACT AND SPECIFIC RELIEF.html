LAW OF CONTRACT AND SPECIFIC RELIEF<br>
(SMART NOTE)<br>

MODULE 1</b><br>
Sections 1 – 9, 30 – 37 and 68 – 72 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872</h1>

<h2>1.1 INTRODUCTION<br>
History and nature of a contractual obligation<br>
Contemporary Relevance</h2><br><br>

<b>History of Contract Law</b><br>
Before 1872, India followed English contract law.<br>
To bring uniform rules for business, agreements and promises,<br>
the British passed the <b>Indian Contract Act, 1872</b>.<br>
It gives rules on how contracts are <b>made, performed and enforced</b>.<br><br>

<b>2. Nature of Contractual Obligation</b><br>
Contractual obligation = <b>Legal duty created by a contract</b>.<br><br>
<b>Important points:</b><br>

<ol>
    <li><b>A contract is created when:</b><br>
        Offer + Acceptance + Consideration + Intention + Free Consent
    </li>

    <li><b>When a contract is formed</b>, parties must legally perform what they promised.</li>
    <li>If someone breaks the promise, <b>they must pay compensation</b>.</li>
    <li>Contractual obligation is always <b>voluntary (self-created)</b>.</li>
    <li>Once accepted, the promise becomes a <b>binding legal duty</b>.</li>
</ol>

<b>Example:</b><br>
A promises to repair B’s phone for ₹800.<br>
Once B agrees, both have <b>legal obligations</b>.<br><br>

<b>3. CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE (Importance Today)</b><br><br>

Contract law is important in today’s modern life because almost everything works through contracts.<br><br>

<b>Where contracts are used today:</b>
<ol>
    <li>Online shopping (Amazon, Flipkart)</li>
    <li>Mobile recharge, OTT subscriptions</li>
    <li>Renting houses</li>
    <li>Job offers & employment letters</li>
    <li>Loans, insurance, bank transactions</li>
    <li>Business partnerships</li>
    <li>Buying/selling goods & services</li>
</ol>

<b>Why contract law matters today:</b>

<ol>
    <li>Creates trust in business</li>
    <li>Protects people from fraud</li>
    <li>Ensures responsibility and accountability</li>
    <li>Helps settle disputes fairly</li>
    <li>Supports India’s digital economy and e-commerce</li>
</ol>

<b>In short:</b><br>
Contract law is the backbone of all modern economic activities.<br><br>

<h2>1.2 OFFER, ACCEPTANCE AND ITS COMMUNICATION</h2><br>

<b>1. OFFER / PROPOSAL (Section 2(a))</b><br><br>

<b>Meaning:</b><br>
When one person shows willingness to do something or not to do something,<br>
with the intention to get the other person’s consent,<br>
it is an <b>offer</b>.<br><br>

<b> Example:</b><br>
A says to B: “I will sell my phone for ₹5,000.” → <b>Offer</b><br><br>

<b>Essentials of a valid offer:</b>

<ol>
    <li>Must be clear and definite</li>
    <li>Must be made with intention to create legal obligation</li>
    <li>Must be communicated to the offeree</li>
    <li>Can be <b>specific</b> (to one person) or <b>general</b> (to the public).

    <li>Cannot be based on <b>silence</b>.</li>
    <li>Terms must be <b>certain</b>.</li><br><br>

<b>2. ACCEPTANCE (Section 2(b))</b><br>
<b>Meaning</b><br>
When the person to whom the offer is made agrees to it,<br>
he is said to have accepted the offer.<br><br>

<b>Simple Example</b><br>
B says: “I agree to buy your phone for ₹5,000.” → Acceptance.<br><br>

<b>Essentials of Valid Acceptance</b><br><br>

<ol>
<li>Must be absolute and unconditional.</li>
<li>Must be communicated to the offeror.</li>
<li>Must be made in the manner prescribed in the offer.</li>
<li>Must be given before offer lapses.</li>
<li>Cannot be given under force, fraud or mistake.</li>
<li>Acceptance must be given by the person to whom the offer is made.</li>
<li>Silence does not mean acceptance.</li>
</ol> <br>
<b>3. COMMUNICATION OF OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE (Sections 3 & 4)</b><br><br>

<b>(A) Communication of Offer</b><br>
Offer is communicated when it comes to the knowledge of the offeree.<br>

<b>Example:</b><br>
A sends a letter offering to sell a bike. B must read it or know about it.<br><br>

<b>(B) Communication of Acceptance</b><br>
There are two perspectives:<br><br>

<b>1. As against the proposer (offeror)</b><br>
Acceptance is complete when it is posted / sent.<br>

<b>Example:</b><br>
B posts a letter accepting A’s offer → acceptance complete against A.<br><br>

<b>2. As against the acceptor</b><br>
Acceptance is complete when it reaches the proposer.<br>

<b>Example:</b><br>
A receives the letter → acceptance complete against B.<br><br>

<b>4. COMMUNICATION OF REVOCATION (Section 5)</b><br><br>
<b>Revocation of Offer</b><br>
Offer can be taken back anytime before acceptance is posted/sent. <br><br>

<b>6. CASE LAWS </b><br><br>

<b>Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.</b><br>
General offer to the public can be accepted by anyone who performs the condition.<br><br>

<b>Felthouse v. Bindley</b><br>
Silence does not amount to acceptance.<br><br>

<b>Lalman Shukla v. Gauri Dutt</b><br>
For acceptance of a general offer, the person must know about the offer.<br><br>

<h2>1.3 Types of Contracts<br>

<h2>2.4 Consideration</h2><br><br>

<b>WHAT IS CONSIDERATION? (Sec. 2(d))</b><br>
<b>Simple Meaning:</b><br>
Something in return.<br>
Each party must give something and get something.<br><br>

<b>Examples:</b><br>
You pay money → shopkeeper gives goods<br>
You teach → student pays fee<br>
You promise something → other party promises something<br><br>

Without consideration = no contract (Sec. 25).<br><br>

<b>FEATURES OF VALID CONSIDERATION</b><br><br>

<ol>
<li>
<b>Must move at the desire of the promisor</b><br>
Your act must be done because the promisor wanted it.<br><br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
A promises to pay B if B paints A’s house → valid.<br>
But B paints without A asking → not valid.
</li><br>

<li>
<b>Can move from promisee or any other person</b><br>
Means third party can also give consideration.<br><br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
A promises to pay B if C performs some work → valid.
</li><br>

<li>
<b>May be past, present, or future</b><br><br>

<b>Past Consideration:</b><br>
Already done, now promised.<br>
Example: A helps B, later B promises ₹1000.<br><br>

<b>Present (Executed) Consideration:</b><br>
Payment or delivery done immediately.<br>
Example: Cash sale.<br><br>

<b>Future (Executory) Consideration:</b><br>
Promise to do something later.<br>
Example: Order online, delivery after 3 days.
</li>
</ol><br>
<b>FEATURES OF VALID CONSIDERATION (Continued)</b><br><br>

<ol>
<li>
<b>Need not be adequate</b><br>
Courts do NOT check if consideration is equal or fair.<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
Selling phone worth ₹20,000 for ₹500 → valid (if free consent).
</li><br>

<li>
<b>Must be real, not imaginary</b><br>
Impossible or uncertain consideration is not valid.<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
“I will give you ₹10,000 if you catch a star” → invalid.
</li><br>

<li>
<b>Must be lawful</b><br>
Cannot be illegal, immoral, or against public policy.
</li>
</ol>

<br>

<h2>2.5 Unlawful Object and Consideration</h2><br><br>

</ol><br>
<b>Other Contracts</b><br>
Legal heirs must perform.
<br><br>

<b>Joint Promisors (Sec. 42–45)</b><br>
All joint promisors are equally responsible.<br>
If one pays → he can recover from others.
<br><br>

<b>TIME AND PLACE OF PERFORMANCE</b><br><br>

<b>Time (Sec. 46–50)</b><br>
If time is fixed, the contract must be performed at that time.<br>
Delay can make contract voidable.<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
Deliver goods on 5th Dec → Must deliver on that day.
<br><br>

<b>Place (Sec. 47–49)</b><br>
If place is not fixed, the promisor must ask the promisee where to perform.<br>
If place is fixed → must perform there.
<br><br>

<b>PERFORMANCE OF RECIPROCAL PROMISES (Sec. 51–57)</b><br><br>

<ol>
<li>
<b>Mutual and Dependent Promises</b><br>
One promise depends on another.<br>
If A does not perform, B need not perform.
</li><br>

<li>
<b>Independent Promises</b><br>
Each must perform even if the other has not performed.
</li><br>

<li>
<b>Simultaneous Performance</b><br>
Both must perform at the same time.<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
Goods delivered → payment made → same moment.
</li><br>

<li>
<b>Impossible Promises (Sec. 56)</b><br>
Impossible acts are void.
</li>
</ol>

<br>

<b>EFFECT OF REFUSAL TO PERFORM (Sec. 39)</b><br><br>
<b>If one party refuses to perform, the other party can:</b><br>
End the contract<br>
Claim damages<br>
This is called <b>anticipatory breach</b> if refusal is before due date.
<br><br>

<b>WHEN PROMISEE MAY DISPENSE WITH PERFORMANCE (Sec. 63)</b><br><br>
<b>Promisee can:</b><br>
Cancel performance<br>
Extend time<br>
Accept lesser performance<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
Accepting ₹7,000 instead of ₹10,000.
<h2>3.2 Discharge of Contract</h2><br><br>

<b>WHAT IS DISCHARGE OF CONTRACT?</b><br>
Discharge = Contract ends.<br>
Parties are free from all legal obligations.<br><br>

<b>WAYS IN WHICH CONTRACT IS DISCHARGED</b><br>
There are 6 main ways:<br><br>

<ol>
<li>
<b>DISCHARGE BY PERFORMANCE</b><br>
Most common.<br>
Both parties fully perform their promises → Contract ends.<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
Seller delivers goods, buyer pays → Over.
</li><br>

<li>
<b>DISCHARGE BY AGREEMENT (Sec. 62–67)</b><br>
Parties mutually agree to end or change the contract.<br><br>

<b>A. Novation</b><br>
Old contract replaced by a new one.<br>

<b>B. Rescission</b><br>
Contract is cancelled by agreement.<br>

<b>C. Alteration</b><br>
Terms are changed but parties remain same.<br>

<b>D. Remission</b><br>
Promisee accepts less performance.<br>
(e.g. Accepting ₹8,000 instead of ₹10,000)<br>

<b>E. Waiver</b><br>
Promisee gives up rights.<br>

<b>F. Accord & Satisfaction</b><br>
New agreement settles old dispute.
</li><br>

<li>
<b>DISCHARGE BY IMPOSSIBILITY (Sec. 56)</b><br>
Contract ends when performance becomes impossible.<br><br>

<b>A. Initial Impossibility</b><br>
Impossible from the start → Void.<br>

<b>B. Subsequent Impossibility</b><br>
Becomes impossible later → Contract ends.<br>

<b>Examples:</b><br>
Death in personal skill contract<br>
Subject matter destroyed (house burns)<br>
Change in law makes performance illegal<br>
War or natural disaster
</li>
</ol><br>
<b>DISCHARGE BY LAPSE OF TIME</b><br>
If a party does not take action within 3 years (Limitation Act), the contract automatically ends.<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
Debt not claimed for 3 years → No legal recovery.
<br><br>

<b>DISCHARGE BY OPERATION OF LAW</b><br>
Contract ends automatically due to law.<br>
<b>Includes:</b><br>
Death (in personal skill contracts)<br>
Insolvency (bankruptcy)<br>
Merger (when inferior right merges into superior right)<br>
Material alteration without consent
<br><br>

<b>DISCHARGE BY BREACH</b><br>
One party refuses or fails to perform → Contract ends.<br><br>

<h2>3.3 Breach of Contract</h2><br><br>

<b>1. Types of Breach</b><br><br>

<ol>
<li>
<b>Actual Breach</b><br>
Happens on the due date or during performance.<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
You promise to deliver goods on 10 Jan but don’t deliver.
</li><br>

<li>
<b>Anticipatory Breach</b><br>
Happens before the due date when one party clearly says “I won’t perform”.<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
Delivery due on 10 Jan, but on 1 Jan you say “I cannot deliver”.<br><br>
<b>Other party can:</b><br>
End contract immediately OR<br>
Wait till due date.
</li>
</ol>
<br>
<b>2. How Breach Happens</b><br><br>
Non-performance<br>
Not doing what was promised. <br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
Not supplying goods.
<br><br>

<b>Defective Performance</b><br>
Doing it wrongly.<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
Supplying damaged goods.
<br><br>

<b>Late Performance</b><br>

<br><br>

<b>3. Remedies for Breach (What the aggrieved party can claim)</b><br><br>

<ol>
<li>
<b>Damages (Money Compensation)</b><br><br>

<b>a) Ordinary / General Damages</b><br>
For direct loss due to breach.<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>

Very small amount.<br>
Given when breach occurred but no actual loss.
</li><br>

<li>
<b>Specific Performance</b><br>

<b>Used when:</b><br>
Subject matter is unique (land, rare items).<br>
Money compensation is not sufficient.
</li><br>

<li>

</li>
</ol>

<br>

<h2>3.4 Types of Damages & Remedies for Breach</h2><br>
<b>⭐ A. TYPES OF DAMAGES</b><br><br>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Ordinary / General Damages</b><br>
Given for direct loss caused by breach.<br>
Naturally arise in the normal course of events.<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
Seller fails to deliver goods → buyer buys from market at higher price → difference paid by seller.
</li><br>

<li>
<b>Special Damages</b><br>
Loss arising from special circumstances.<br>
Such circumstances must be known to both parties at the time of contract.<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>

</li><br>

<li>
<b>Exemplary / Punitive Damages</b><br>
Rare in contract law.<br>
Given to punish the wrongdoer.<br>
<b>Examples:</b><br>

</li><br>

<li>
<b>Nominal Damages</b><br>
Very small amount of damages.<br>

<h2>MODULE 4<br>
4.1 Origin of Specific Relief as Equitable Relief</h2><br><br>

<b>⭐ Meaning of Specific Relief</b><br>
Specific Relief means the court orders the exact performance of what was promised in the contract.<br>

<b>Note:</b><br>
It is not a punishment.<br>
It is a correction of a wrong. <br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
If a person takes advance money but refuses to give the house,<br>
the court orders that person to perform the contract and transfer the house.

<br><br>

<b>⭐ 2. Origin of Specific Relief (How it Started)</b><br><br>

<b>(a) Origin in English Equity Courts</b><br><br>

<b>Before modern laws, England had two types of courts:</b><br><br>

<b>Common Law Courts</b><br>
These courts awarded damages (money compensation only).<br><br>

<b>Equity Courts (Chancery Courts)</b><br><br>
<b>These courts provided fair remedies such as:</b><br>
Specific Performance<br>
Injunction<br>
Rescission<br><br>

<b>Damages were not sufficient in cases involving land, unique items,
or trust property.<br>
Therefore, Equity Courts developed the concept of Specific Relief
to ensure fairness.</b>

<br><br>

<b>(b) Basis of Specific Relief – “Equity and Good Conscience”</b><br><br>
<b>Equity Courts acted on principles of:<br></b>
Fairness<br>
Justice<br>
Good conscience<br>
Reasonableness<br>
<b>These principles became the foundation of Specific Relief law.</b>

<br><br>

<b>(c) Adoption in India</b><br>
India followed English legal principles during British rule.<br>
Originally, Specific Relief was part of Contract and Civil Law.<br><br>

In 1877, the Specific Relief Act, 1877 was enacted based on English equity principles.<br>
In 1963, the law was updated as the Specific Relief Act, 1963 (present law).

<br><br>

<b>⭐ 3. Why Specific Relief Was Needed?</b><br>
Because money compensation is not always adequate.<br><br>

<b>Examples:</b><br>
Land or property cannot be replaced by money.<br>
Rare painting or unique item cannot be compensated by damages.<br>
Sometimes a person must be stopped from breaking a contract (injunction).<br><br>

Therefore, courts grant equitable relief instead of only damages.

<br><br>

<b>⭐ 4. Nature of Specific Relief</b><br><br>
<b>Discretionary –</b> granted at the discretion(way as to avoid causing offence) of the court.<br>
<b>Equitable –</b> based on justice and good conscience.<br>
<b>Corrective –</b> aims to restore the injured party’s rights. <br><br>
<b>⭐ 5. Key Features of Specific Relief</b><br><br>

Based on English Equity System.<br>
Developed because damages were not sufficient in many cases.<br>
Adopted into Indian law through the Specific Relief Act, 1877.<br>
Later updated as the Specific Relief Act, 1963.<br>
Provides remedies like:<br>
Specific Performance<br>
Injunctions<br>
Rescission<br>
Rectification<br>
Cancellation of instruments
<br><br>

<b>4.2 KINDS OF RELIEF UNDER SPECIFIC RELIEF ACT, 1963</b><br><br>

The Act provides different remedies when a civil right is violated.<br>
These remedies are based on:<br>
Equity<br>
Justice<br>
Good conscience
<br><br>

<b>4.2.1 POSSESSORY REMEDIES (Recovery of Possession)</b><br><br>

Used when someone unlawfully takes or keeps another person’s property.<br><br>

<b>Includes:</b><br>
Recovery of movable property (Section 7).<br>
Recovery of immovable property (Section 5 & 6).<br><br>

<b>Key Point:</b><br>
Even a person in wrongful possession can recover property from a later wrongdoer,<br>
because law protects possession.
<br><br>

<b>Example:</b><br>
A tenant is illegally thrown out → tenant can file a suit to restore possession.
<br><br>

<b>4.2.2 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS</b><br><br>

Court orders a party to perform the exact terms of the contract.<br><br>

<b>Given when:</b><br>
Contract is valid and enforceable.<br>
Subject matter is unique.<br>
Money compensation is not adequate. <br>
like:Contracts dependent on personal skills<br>
<b>Example:</b> singer, painter, actor.</li> <br><br>
<b>4.2.3 CONTRACTS THAT CANNOT BE SPECIFICALLY PERFORMED</b><br>
Court will <b>NOT</b> order specific performance for:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Contracts dependent on personal skills<br>
      Example: singer, painter, actor.</li>
  <li>Contracts involving continuous duties<br>
      Example: running a business daily.</li>
  <li>Contracts that are uncertain<br>
      Example: vague terms like “best quality”.</li>
  <li>Contracts where performance is impossible.</li>
  <li>Contracts made by persons who cannot be compelled<br>
      Example: minors, mentally unsound persons.</li>
</ul>
In these cases, <b>remedy is damages, not specific performance.</b><br><br>

<b>4.2.4 SUBSTITUTED PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACT (Section 20)</b><br><br>
<b>If one party breaks the contract, the aggrieved party can:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Get the work done by a third party, and</li>
  <li>Recover the cost from the defaulting party.</li>
</ul><br>
Note: <b>No need to wait for court order.</b><br>
But → <b>must give 30-day notice before substituted performance.</b><br><br>
<b>Example:</b> A contractor does not build a wall → owner hires another and claims cost.<br><br>
<b>4.2.5 RECTIFICATION OF INSTRUMENTS (Section 26)</b><br><br>
Fixing mistakes in written documents (contract, deed) so it matches the real intention.<br>
<b>Used when:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>There is fraud, or</li>
  <li>A mutual mistake of both parties.</li>
</ul>
<b>Example:</b> Sale deed wrongly writes 100 sq ft instead of 1000 sq ft → court rectifies.<br><br>

<b>4.2.6 RESCISSION OF CONTRACT (Section 27)</b><br><br>
Court cancels the contract when:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Contract was obtained by fraud/misrepresentation</li>

<ul>
  <li>Void or voidable, or</li>
  <li>May cause harm if left outstanding</li>
</ul>
<b>Purpose:</b> prevent future mischief or litigation.<br>
<b>Example:</b> Forged deed, illegal agreement → court cancels.<br><br>

<b>4.2.8 DECLARATORY DECREE (Section 34)</b><br><br>
Court issues a declaration regarding a legal right or status.<br>
Used when a person wants clarity about what is legally correct.<br>
<b>Examples:<br></b>
<ul>
  <li>Declaring who is the real owner of property</li>
  <li>Declaring a document void</li>
  <li>Declaring legal status (marriage, adoption)</li>
</ul>
No damages are awarded → only declaration.<br><br>

<b>4.2.9 INJUNCTIONS (Sections 36–42)</b><br><br>
<b>court orders someone:</b><br>
