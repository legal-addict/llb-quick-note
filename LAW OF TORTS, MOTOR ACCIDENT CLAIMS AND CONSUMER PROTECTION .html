        <h2>MODULE 1: General Principles of Tort</h2>
        <h2>1.1 Tort: Definition, Nature, Scope and object of Tort, Tort in India.</h2><br>
        <b>1. What is a Tort?</b><br>
        Tort means a civil wrong.<br>
        It happens when:<br>
        • Someone has a duty to behave properly,<br>
        • They break that duty,<br>
        • Someone else suffers loss or injury,<br>
        • And the victim can get compensation (money).<br><br>

        <b>Example:</b><br>
        <div class="example">
            A drives carelessly → hits B → B gets injury →  
            B can claim compensation = Tort.
        </div>
        <br>
        <b>2. Nature of Tort</b><br>
        • It is a civil wrong (person vs person).<br>
        • The main result is compensation, not jail.<br>
        • It is not written in one book (not a code).<br>
        • It is made by judges through cases.<br>
        • It protects private rights like body, property, reputation.<br><br>

        <b>3. Scope of Tort (What it covers)</b><br>
        Tort covers many types of wrongs:<br>
        Personal wrongs
        Beating someone<br>
        Threatening<br>
        Calling someone bad names (defamation)<br>
        Wrongly locking someone in a room<br><br>

        <b>Property wrongs</b><br>
         Entering someone’s land<br>
         Damaging someone’s things<br>
         Causing nuisance (noise, smell, pollution)<br><br>

        <b>Other wrongs</b><br>
         Negligence (carelessness)<br>
         Fraud<br>
         Harm caused by employees for which employer is liable<br><br>

        <b>4. Object (Purpose) of Tort Law</b><br>
        Why does tort law exist?<br>
        • To give compensation to the victim.<br>
        • To stop people from doing wrongful acts.<br>
        • To protect rights of people (body, property, reputation).<br>
        • To maintain peace by solving disputes peacefully.<br><br>

        <b>5. Tort in India</b><br>
        India follows English Tort Law.<br>
        It is not written in a single Indian law book.<br>
        Indian courts expanded tort through judgments.<br>
        Government can also be made responsible for its employees’ wrongs.<br><br>

    <b>Important case in India</b><br>
    Bhopal Gas Tragedy → Absolute Liability<br>
    → Industries handling dangerous things must pay compensation even if they were not careless.

<br>

• Tort = compensation<br>
• Contract breach = breaking promise<br>
• Crime = punishment<br>
• Quasi-contract = return money wrongly received

<h2>1.3 Damnum Sine Injuria, Injuria Sine Damnum</h2>

<b>1. Damnum Sine Injuria</b><br>
<b>Meaning:</b><br>
Damage (loss) without legal injury.<br>
You suffer loss, but no legal right is violated → No tort, no compensation.<br><br>

<b>Example:</b><br>
A opens a shop next to B.<br>
B loses customers.<br>
B suffers money loss, but A did nothing illegal.<br>
→ No compensation.<br><br>


<b>2. Injuria Sine Damnum</b><br>
<b>Meaning:</b><br>
Legal injury without actual loss.<br>
Your legal right is violated, even if you suffer no monetary loss.<br>
→ Tort exists, compensation possible.<br><br>

<b>Example:</b><br>
A is stopped from entering a public park even though he has a right.<br>
No money loss, but his legal right is violated.<br>
→ Tort.<br><br>


<h2>1.4 Volenti non-fit injuria, Ubi jus ibi remedium</h2>

<b>1. Volenti Non Fit Injuria</b><br>
<b>Meaning:</b><br>
“If a person voluntarily agrees to a risk, they cannot complain later.”<br>

Volenti = voluntarily<br>
Non fit injuria = no injury (in law)<br><br>

<b>Simple idea:</b><br>
If you knew the risk + accepted the risk, then no compensation. <br>
<b>Ex. Sports injuries</b><br>
Players accept the risk of getting hurt.<br>
→ No tort if injury happens in normal play.<br><br>

<b>Important Conditions:</b><br>
The person must have full knowledge of the risk.<br>
The person must freely agree (no force).<br><br>


<b>2. Ubi Jus Ibi Remedium</b><br>
<b>Meaning:</b><br>
“Where there is a right, there is a remedy.”<br>

If your legal right is violated, the law gives you a solution/remedy.<br><br>

<b>Simple idea:</b><br>
Every right has a protection.<br>
If someone violates your rights, courts will help you.<br><br>

<b>Examples:</b><br>
<b>Right to property</b><br>
Someone enters your land → You can go to court.<br><br>

<b>Right to reputation</b><br>
Someone spreads false rumours → You can sue for defamation.<br><br>

<b>Right to move freely</b><br>
Wrongly stopped by police → You can claim compensation.<br><br>

<b>Right to vote</b><br>
If someone illegally stops you → You get a legal remedy.<br><br>


<b>When it does NOT apply:</b><br>
This principle does not apply for:<br>
Moral wrongs (hurting feelings without legal harm)<br>
Political wrongs (no legal right violated)<br><br>


<h2>1.5 Extinguishment of Liability in Tort</h2>

<b>Meaning:</b><br>
Extinguishment of liability means:<br>
The tort liability ends → the wrongdoer (defendant) no longer has to pay or face the claim.<br><br>

<b>In simple words:</b><br>
When a tort case ends or the right to sue gets cancelled. <br>
<b>1. Death of Parties</b><br>
If the wrongdoer or the injured person dies, in many tort cases the claim ends.<br><br>


<b>2. Waiver (Giving Up the Right)</b><br>
The injured person chooses not to sue even when they can.<br>

<b>Example:</b><br>
A was hurt by B’s negligence.<br>
A says “I forgive you, I won’t take action.”<br>
→ A has waived the right → liability ends.<br><br>


<b>3. Accord and Satisfaction (Settlement)</b><br>
Both parties settle the matter outside court.<br>
The injured person accepts money/compensation, and the issue is closed.<br><br>


<b>4. Limitation (Time Over)</b><br>
Every tort has a time limit (normally 1–3 years).<br>
If the injured person files the case after the time expires, liability ends.<br>

<b>Example:</b><br>
A injured B on 1 Jan 2023.<br>
Limitation = 1 year.<br>
Case filed in Feb 2025 → Too late → No case.<br><br>


<b>5. Contributory Negligence</b><br>
If the plaintiff is also responsible for the harm, compensation reduces or ends.<br>

<b>Example:</b><br>
A and B both were careless while driving.<br>
Accident happens.<br>
Court says A was also 50% at fault → B’s liability reduces.<br><br>


<b>6. Act of God (Natural Event)</b><br>
If harm is caused by natural forces and no one is at fault → No liability.<br>

<b>Example:</b><br>
Tree falls on A’s car because of a sudden earthquake.<br>
→ Nobody is responsible → No liability.<br><br>


<b>7. Statutory Authority</b><br>
If the law allows someone to do an act, and harm occurs during that lawful act → No liability.<br>

<b>Example:</b><br>
Municipal corporation demolishes an illegal building under law.<br>
Owner cannot sue for damage.
→ Liability ends.<br><br>


<b>8. Plaintiff’s Default (Plaintiff’s own fault)</b><br>
If injury happens because of the plaintiff’s own mistake, defendant not liable.<br>

<b>Example:</b><br>
A ignores “High Voltage – Danger” sign and touches the wire.<br>
→ A responsible for own injury → No liability.<br><br>


<h2>1.6 General Defenses and Discharge of Torts</h2>

<b>Meaning</b><br>
General Defences = Reasons that allow the defendant to escape liability even if a tort happened.<br><br>

<b>In simple words:</b><br>
“Yes, harm happened, but I am not legally responsible because of this defence.”<br><br>


<b>1. Consent (Volenti Non Fit Injuria)</b><br>
If the plaintiff agreed/accepted the risk, no liability.<br>

<b>Example:</b><br>
You watch a cricket match → ball hits you<br>
You join boxing → you may get hurt<br>
→ You accepted the risk → no compensation<br><br>


<b>2. Act of God (Natural Forces)</b><br>
Damage caused by natural events that humans cannot prevent.<br>

<b>Example:</b><br>
Earthquake<br>
Flood<br>
Lightning<br>
→ No liability because no one controlled it.<br><br>


<b>3. Inevitable Accident</b><br>
Accident that could not be prevented even with full care.<br>

<b>Example:</b><br>
A sudden tire burst of a well-maintained car.<br>
→ Driver not liable.<br><br>


<b>4. Private Defence (Self-Defence)</b><br>
A person can protect life, body, property with reasonable force. <br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
A thief attacks B → B pushes him in self-defence → no liability.<br><br>


<b>5. Necessity</b><br>
Doing harm to prevent bigger harm.<br>

<b>Example:</b><br>
A cuts B’s land to stop a spreading fire → no liability.<br><br>


<b>6. Statutory Authority</b><br>
If law authorises an act, no liability.<br>

<b>Example:</b><br>
Municipal corporation demolishes illegal construction → cannot be sued.<br><br>


<b>7. Mistake (Sometimes accepted)</b><br>
An honest mistake without negligence may be a defence.<br>

<b>Example:</b><br>
Police arrest a person who looks like the real suspect → genuine mistake → no liability.<br><br>


<b>8. Plaintiff’s Own Wrong (Plaintiff at Fault)</b><br>
If the injury happened due to plaintiff’s own carelessness, defendant not liable.<br>

<b>Example:</b><br>
A ignores “DANGER – HIGH VOLTAGE” sign and touches the wire.<br>
→ A at fault → no claim.<br><br>


<b>9. Contributory Negligence</b><br>
Both parties share the fault → defendant’s liability reduces or ends.<br>

<b>Example:</b><br>
Both drivers were careless → damages divided.<br><br>

 <h2> MODULE 3: <br>
 Principles of Liability in Torts and Legal Remedies <br>
    3.1 Vicarious Liability: Basis, scope, Justification, Different types</h2>
  <b>3.1 Vicarious Liability</b><br>

<b>Meaning:</b><br>
Vicarious liability = One person is held liable for the wrongful act of another, due to a special relationship.<br>
Master liable for servant’s act<br>
Employer liable for employee<br>
Principal liable for agent<br><br>

<b>Basis of Vicarious Liability (Why it is applied?):</b><br>

<b>1. Master–Servant Relationship</b><br>
If a servant (employee) does a wrongful act in the course of employment, the master (employer) is liable.<br>

<b>2. Control Test</b><br>
The master has the right to control how the servant works →<br>
So master is liable.<br>

<b>3. Benefit Test</b><br>
Employee was doing something that benefited the employer,<br>
So employer must take responsibility.<br>

<b>4. Social Convenience</b><br>
To make sure injured people get compensation from someone who can pay (employer).<br><br>

<b>3. Scope (When it applies):</b><br>
Vicarious liability applies when:<br>
<b>✓ The wrongdoer is an employee, not an independent contractor</b><br>
Example: Driver hired on salary → employer liable<br>
Uber/Auto driver (independent) → company not liable<br>

<b>✓ The act was done during course of employment</b><br>

<b>Meaning:</b><br>
During working hours<br>
Using employer’s tools/vehicle<br>
For employer’s work<br>

<b>Employer NOT liable if:</b><br>
Employee was doing personal work<br>
Employee acted outside employment<br>
Example: Driver takes car for girlfriend → accident → employer not liable<br><br>

<b>4. Justification (Why law makes employer responsible?):</b><br>
<b>✔Employer gets the benefit of employee’s work</b><br>
 So employer must take the risk too.
<br>

<b>✔ Employer has control over the employee</b><br>
So employer must ensure safety and good conduct.
<br>

<b>✔ Victim can get compensation easily</b><br>
Employer generally has more money or insurance.
<br>

<b>✔ Encourages employers to train employees properly</b>
<br><br>

<b>5. Different Types of Vicarious Liability</b>
<br><br>

<b>1. Master &amp; Servant (Most Important)</b><br>
Employer is liable for acts of the employee done during the course of employment.
<br>

<b>2. Principal &amp; Agent</b><br>
Principal is liable for actions of agent done within authority.<br>
<b>Example:</b> Real estate agent makes a contract → principal is bound.
<br>

<b>3. Partners in Partnership Firm</b><br>
Every partner is liable for torts done by another partner in the course of business.
<br>

<b>4. State / Government Liability</b><br>
Government is liable for acts of public servants while performing government duties.
<br>

<b>5. Parents &amp; Children (in some cases)</b><br>
Parents may be liable if the child was acting under their control (rare in India).
<br>

<b>6. Company &amp; Directors / Employees</b><br>
Company is liable for mistakes committed by employees during official work.

<h2>3.2 Principle of Strict Liability: Rylands v. Fletcher (with exceptions)</h2><br>

<b>Meaning of Strict Liability:</b><br>
Strict Liability = A person is liable for the harm even if they were not negligent.<br>
“Galti chahe ho ya na ho, nuksaan hua to bharna padega”<br>
If someone keeps something dangerous on their land and it escapes and causes damage → owner must pay.<br><br>

<b>Rylands v. Fletcher (1868) – Main Case:</b><br>

<b>Facts:</b><br>
Rylands built a reservoir (water tank).<br>
Water leaked through old mine shafts and flooded Fletcher’s coal mine.<br>
Fletcher suffered loss.<br>

<b>Held:</b><br>
Rylands was liable even though he did not know about the old shafts.<br>
Strict Liability principle created.<br><br>

<b>Essential Conditions of Strict Liability:</b><br>
<ol>
  <li>Dangerous thing brought on land</li>
  <li>Non-natural use of land</li>
  <li>Thing must escape</li>
  <li>Damage must be caused</li>
</ol><br>

<b>Exceptions to Strict Liability:</b><br>
<ol>
  <li>Act of God (natural disaster)</li>
  <li>Act of third party</li>
  <li>Consent of the plaintiff</li>
  <li>Statutory authority</li>
  <li>Plaintiff’s own fault</li>
</ol>
<b>3. Essential Conditions (When strict liability applies?)</b><br>

<b>1. Dangerous Thing</b><br>
Something harmful if it escapes:<br>
Water, gas, explosives, electricity, chemicals, oil, wild animals.<br>

<b>2. Non-Natural Use of Land</b><br>
 means:

👉 Using land in an unusual or special way that increases danger to others, not the ordinary, everyday use of land.
Use which increases danger.<br>
Examples:<br>
Storing large water tank<br>
Chemical factory<br>
Keeping explosives<br>
Not natural use: gardening, ordinary water supply.<br>

<b>3. Escape of the Thing</b><br>
The danger must leave the defendant’s property and cause damage.<br>
Example: Water leaks out & floods neighbor’s land.<br><br>

<b>4. Exceptions to Strict Liability</b><br>

<b>1. Plaintiff’s Fault</b><br>
If the injured person helped cause the harm, defendant not liable.<br>
Example: Someone opens the gate of a water tank and water flows out.<br>

<b>2. Act of God (Natural Disaster)</b><br>
Damage caused by uncontrollable natural forces.<br>
Example: Earthquake breaks dam → water escapes → no liability.<br>

<b>3. Act of a Third Party</b><br>
A stranger (not employee) causes the escape.<br>
Example: Unknown person breaks the tank → water escapes.<br>

<b>4. Consent of Plaintiff (Volenti Non Fit Injuria)</b><br>
If the plaintiff agreed to the risk.<br>
Example: Two neighbours share a water tank → both consented to risk.<br>

<b>5. Statutory Authority</b><br>
If the act is authorized by law and done carefully → no liability.<br>
Example: Government water tank bursts despite best precautions.<br>

<b>6. Natural Use of Land</b><br>
If use of land is ordinary or natural → strict liability doesn’t apply.<br>
Example: Normal household water pipeline bursts.<br>

<h2>3.3 Principle of Absolute Liability</h2>
<h2>Bhopal Gas Disaster case and Shree Ram Food Oleum Gas Leakage case and orientation to Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991</h2><br>

<b>1. Bhopal Gas Disaster Case (1984)</b><br>
Union Carbide Case – Basis of Absolute Liability in India<br><br>

<b>What happened?</b><br>
A poisonous gas Methyl Isocyanate (MIC) leaked from the Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal.<br>
Thousands died instantly; lakhs suffered permanent injuries.<br>
Worst industrial disaster in the world.<br><br>

<b>Key Points:</b><br>
Company argued: “It was an accident, not our fault.”<br>
Supreme Court: Company must pay compensation.<br>
Government of India settled for $470 million.<br><br>

<b>Legal Principle Developed:</b><br>
<b>Absolute Liability</b><br>
If an industry deals with ultra-hazardous (very dangerous) substances, and they escape →<br>
The company is 100% liable, even if:<br>
They took all safety measures<br>
It was an accident<br>
Error by a third party<br>
Act of God<br><br>

<b>No excuses allowed.<br>
Stronger than Strict Liability.</b><br><br>

<b>2. Shree Ram Food & Fertilizer (Oleum Gas Leak Case, 1985)</b><br>
Also known as M.C. Mehta vs Union of India<br><br>

<b>What happened?</b><br>
Oleum gas leaked from Shree Ram factory in Delhi.<br>
1 person died; many were injured.<br>
Public interest litigation filed by M.C. Mehta, an environmental lawyer.<br>
<b>Court’s Important Rulings</b><br><br>

<b>1. Absolute Liability Introduced</b><br>
Supreme Court said:<br>
Industries dealing with dangerous chemicals have absolute liability.<br>
No exceptions, no escape.<br>
This became a foundation for environmental safety law in India.<br>

<b>2. “Deep Pocket Principle”</b><br>
Big industries earning profits must also bear responsibility for safety.<br>

<b>3. Duty to Install Safety Systems</b><br>
Gas industries must keep:<br>
alarms<br>
emergency shutdown<br>
regular inspections<br>
safety training<br><br>

<b>4. Laid groundwork for Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991</b><br><br>

<b>Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991</b><br>

<b>Purpose:</b><br>
Created after Bhopal & Oleum gas accidents.<br>
To ensure instant compensation to people affected by accidents involving hazardous substances.<br><br>

<b>Why created?</b><br>
Earlier compensation took years (like Bhopal case).<br>
People needed fast and direct payment.<br><br>

<b>Key Features of PLI Act, 1991</b><br>

<b>1. Mandatory Insurance</b><br>
All industries handling dangerous substances must take insurance,<br>
so victims get quick compensation.<br>

<b>2. No Need to Prove Negligence</b><br>
Victim gets compensation without proving company was at fault.<br>
Just show that accident happened → compensation automatically applies.<br>

<b>3. Immediate Relief</b><br>
Company + insurance company must give instant money for:<br>
death<br>
injury<br>
property damage<br>

<b>4. Environmental Relief Fund (ERF)</b><br>
A special fund made by Government,<br>
helps when compensation is more than insurance amount.<br>

<b>5. Strict Punishment</b><br>
If company operates without insurance → heavy fines + closure.
<h2>3.4 Judicial and Extra Judicial Remedies</h2><br>

<b>1. Meaning</b><br>

<b>Judicial Remedies</b><br>
Remedies given by Court after the victim files a case.<br>
Court helps you.<br><br>

<b>Extra-Judicial Remedies</b><br>
Remedies taken by the victim without going to court (self-help but legally allowed).<br>
You help yourself (legally).<br><br>

<b>2. Judicial Remedies (Court Remedies)</b><br>
These are the remedies a court gives when a tort is committed.<br>

<b>1. Damages (Money Compensation)</b><br>
The most common remedy.<br>

<b>Types (in easy language):</b><br>
Nominal damages → small amount; rights violated but no big loss.<br>
Compensatory damages → actual loss suffered.<br>
Punitive / Exemplary damages → to punish the wrongdoer.<br>
Aggravated damages → extra compensation for humiliation or mental pain.<br>

<b>2. Injunction</b><br>
Court order to stop or prevent a wrongful act.<br>

<b>Types:</b><br>
Prohibitory injunction → Stop doing something.<br>
Mandatory injunction → Court orders you to do something.<br>
Example: Stop loud noise; remove illegal construction.<br>

<b>3. Specific Restitution of Property</b><br>
Court orders the return of wrongfully taken goods/property.<br>
Example: If someone takes your bike illegally, court orders it returned.<br>

<b>4. Specific Performance</b><br>
Court orders a party to perform a promised duty (usually in contracts).<br><br>

<b>3. Extra-Judicial Remedies (Self-Help Remedies)</b><br>
These are actions a person can legally take without going to court. <br>
<b>Extra-Judicial Remedies (Self-Help Remedies)</b><br>

<b>1. Self-Defense (Private Defense)</b><br>
You can protect yourself, your property, or someone else from harm.<br>
But force used must be reasonable, not excessive.<br>

<b>2. Expulsion of Trespasser</b><br>
You can remove a trespasser from your property peacefully.<br>
Example: Someone enters your land → you can tell them to leave or gently guide them out (without violence).<br>

<b>3. Re-entry on Land</b><br>
If someone illegally occupies your land, you can peacefully re-enter your own land.<br>

<b>4. Re-caption / Re-possession of Goods</b><br>
If someone wrongfully takes your goods, you can take them back immediately, without going to court.<br>
Example: Your stolen bag is found with a thief → you can take it back.<br>

<b>5. Abatement of Nuisance</b><br>
You can remove the source of nuisance yourself.<br>
Example:<br>
Overhanging branch entering your property → you can cut the part entering your side.<br>
Loudspeaker causing noise → you can switch it off if safe.<br>

<b>6. Distress Damage Feasant</b><br>
If an animal enters your land and causes damage, you can seize the animal until the owner pays compensation.<br>
Example: Neighbor’s cow destroys your crops → you can hold the cow.<br>

<h2>MODULE 4: Concept of Consumer & Consumer Protection Act 2019</h2>

<h2>4.1 Consumer:
 Definition: Defect in Goods</h2>
<b> 1. Who is a Consumer? (Section 2(7))</b><br>
✔ Consumer = A person who: <br>
Buys goods for use (not for resale or business), or <br>
Uses services for personal use (not for commercial benefit), <br>
And pays money for it (or promises to pay).<br>

<b>Includes:</b><br>
Any person who is using the goods/services with the buyer’s permission.<br><br>

<b>Not a Consumer:</b><br>
One who buys for resale<br>
One who buys goods/services for commercial use<br>

<b>Exception:</b><br>
Person buying for self-employment (like a tailor buying a sewing machine for own work) → still a consumer<br><br>
<b>2. What is “Goods”?</b><br>
Items you can buy and own, like:<br>
Phone<br>
Clothes<br>
Laptop<br>
Food<br>
Car<br><br>

<b>3. What is a “Defect” in Goods? (Section 2(10))</b><br>
<b>Defect</b> = Any fault / imperfection / shortcoming in goods related to:<br>
Quality<br>
Quantity<br>
Purity<br>
Potency<br>
Standard<br>
Functioning<br>
Performance<br>

Goods do not match what seller promised or what law requires.<br><br>

<b>4. Examples of Defect in Goods</b><br>

<b>Quality Defect</b><br>
You buy a mobile claimed to have 128GB, but it has only 64GB.<br>
You buy milk marked “pure,” but it is mixed with water.<br>

<b>Quantity Defect</b><br>
Packet says 1 kg rice, but weight is only 900g.<br>

<b>Purity Defect</b><br>
Tonic or food item contains harmful substances.<br>

<b>Potency Defect</b><br>
Medicine that fails to cure because it is expired or weak.<br>

<b>Standard Defect</b><br>
Goods do not meet prescribed standards (ISI/AGMARK/BIS).<br>
Example: Electrical wire without safety standard mark causes short circuit.<br>
Uses services for personal use (not for commercial benefit),
And pays money for it (or promises to pay).<br>

<b>Includes:</b><br>
Any person who is using the goods/services with the buyer’s permission.<br><br>


<b>Functioning / Performance Defect</b><br>
Fan not rotating properly.<br>
Laptop heating too much.<br><br>

<b>5. Important Points</b><br>
If goods are not as advertised, it is a defect.<br>
If goods do not meet legal standards, it is a defect.<br>
If seller hides a problem → defect + unfair trade practice.<br><br>

<b>Third-Party Risks (Compulsory Insurance)</b><br>
<b>(Sections 146–150)</b><br>

<b>Meaning of “Third Party”:</b><br>
Any person other than the driver or owner of the vehicle. <br>
Meaning

When a vehicle causes an accident, any person other than the owner or driver is called a third party.
The risk or loss suffered by them is called third-party risk.
<br><br>

<b>Examples:</b>
<ol>
  <li>Pedestrian</li>
  <li>Passenger</li>
  <li>Driver of another vehicle</li>
  <li>Property of others</li>
</ol>

<br>

<b>Compulsory Third-Party Insurance (TP Insurance)</b><br>
<ol>
  <li>Every vehicle must have third-party insurance</li>
  <li>Driving without it is illegal</li>
  <li>Purpose is to protect innocent victims</li>
</ol>

<br>

<b>Covers:</b>
<ol>
  <li>Damage to third-party property</li>
  <li>Legal liabilities of the owner or driver</li>
</ol>

<br>

<b>Does NOT Cover:</b>
<ol>
  <li>Damage to owner’s own vehicle (requires own-damage insurance)</li>
  <li>Driver’s own injuries (requires Personal Accident Cover)</li>
</ol>

<br>

<b>Why Third-Party Insurance is Important?</b><br>
<b>Because:</b>
<ol>
  <li>Accident victims get guaranteed compensation</li>
  <li>Prevents vehicle owner from paying huge amounts personally</li>
  <li>Ensures social security on roads</li>
</ol>

<br>

<b>Insurer’s Liability in Third-Party Claims</b><br>
<b>The insurance company must pay when:</b>
<ol>
  <li>The accident involved the insured vehicle</li>
  <li>A third party suffered injury, death, or property loss</li>
  <li>The policy was valid on the date of accident</li>
</ol>

<br>

<b>Insurer May Refuse Only If:</b>
<ol>
  <li>Driver had no valid driving license</li>
  <li>Vehicle was used for an unauthorized purpose</li>
  <li>Policy was obtained by fraud</li>
</ol>

<br>

<b>Note:</b><br>
Even in these situations, courts often protect the victim first and may direct the insurer to pay compensation initially.<br>

<br>

<b>When Both Apply?</b><br>
<b>Victim Can Get:</b>
<ol>
  <li>Immediate no-fault compensation (Section 140)</li>
  <li>Higher fault-based compensation (Section 166)</li>
</ol>

<br>

<b>Both compensations are allowed under law.</b>
