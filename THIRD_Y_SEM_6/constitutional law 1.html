4. Promote Justice (social, economic, political).<br>
5. Ensure Rule of Law – everyone must follow the law.<br>
6. Ensure Democracy – people have a say in government.<br><br>

<b>4. Features of Constitution</b><br>

- Can be written or based on customs.<br>
- May be easy or hard to change.<br>
- Separates powers: Legislature, Executive, Judiciary.<br>
- Gives Fundamental Rights to citizens.<br>
- Gives Directive Principles – guides government to help people.<br><br>

<b>5. Types of Constitution Philosophy</b><br>
- Liberal – focus on individual freedom (example: USA).<br>

- G – Government power<br>
- P – Protect people<br>
- R – Rights of citizens<br>
- J – Justice for all<br>

<b>Constitution as a Basic Norm</b><br><br>

<b>1. Meaning:</b><br>
- The Constitution is the **fundamental rule** of the country.<br>
- All laws and government actions must follow it.<br>
- It is like the **foundation of a building**; everything else depends on it.<br><br>

<b>2. Basic Norm Concept (Kelsen)</b><br>
- A famous jurist, **Hans Kelsen**, said: The Constitution is the **"basic norm" (Grundnorm)**.<br>
- It means: All laws are valid **because the Constitution exists**.<br>
- Even if we pass a new law, it is valid **only if it follows the Constitution**.<br><br>

<b>3. Features of Constitution as Basic Norm</b><br>
1. It is **supreme** – no law can go against it.<br>
2. It gives **authority** to make other laws.<br>
3. It provides **rules for government powers**.<br>

- If a law goes against the Constitution → it is **invalid**.<br>
<b>Rule of Law and Constitutionalism</b><br><br>

<b>1. Rule of Law – Meaning:</b><br>
- Rule of Law means **no one is above the law**, not even the government.<br>

<b>5. Difference Between Rule of Law and Constitutionalism:</b><br>
- Rule of Law = Everyone, including government, must follow the law.<br>

<b>Constitution as a Living Document</b><br><br>

<b>1. Meaning:</b><br>
- A living constitution means it can **adapt to changing times**.<br>
- It is **not fixed**; it can grow with society.<br>
- The constitution **remains relevant** even as society, technology, and values change.<br><br>

<b>2. Why it is called “Living”?</b><br>
1. Society and technology are always changing.<br>
2. Laws made long ago may need **new interpretation** today.<br>
3. Courts interpret the Constitution in a way that **fits current needs**.<br>

<b>6. Easy Way to Remember:</b><br>
- Constitution = Living Document → **Adapts and changes with society**.<br>
<b>Forms and Models of Constitution</b><br><br>

<b>1. Forms of Constitution</b><br>
- Forms explain **how government is organized and power is distributed**.<br><br>

<b>A. Written vs Unwritten Constitution</b><br>
1. Written Constitution:<br>
- All rules are **written in one document**.<br>
- Example: India, USA.<br>
2. Unwritten Constitution:<br>
- Rules come from **customs, conventions, and past decisions**.<br>
- Example: UK.<br><br>

<b>B. Flexible vs Rigid Constitution</b><br>
1. Flexible:<br>
- Can be changed like **ordinary laws**.<br>
- Example: UK.<br>
2. Rigid:<br>
- **Difficult to change**; special procedure needed.<br>
- Example: USA, India.<br><br>

<b>C. Federal vs Unitary Constitution</b><br>
1. Federal:<br>
- Power is shared between **central and state governments**.<br>
- Example: India, USA.<br>
2. Unitary:<br>
- Power is **concentrated in central government**.<br>
- Example: UK, France.<br><br>

<b>2. Models of Constitution</b><br>
- Models explain **the way power is exercised and organized**.<br><br>

<b>1. Parliamentary Model</b><br>
- Executive (Prime Minister + Ministers) comes from Parliament.<br>
- Government depends on Parliament to stay in power.<br>
- Head of State (President or Monarch) is mostly ceremonial.<br>
- Example: India, UK.<br>
- Easy way to remember: Parliament chooses government; government can fall if it loses support.<br><br>

<b>2. Presidential Model</b><br>
- President is elected separately and is independent of legislature.<br>
- President is both Head of State and Head of Government.<br>
- Legislature cannot remove President easily.<br>
- Example: USA.<br>
- Easy way to remember: President is boss; Parliament cannot fire them.<br><br>

<b>3. Hybrid / Semi-Presidential Model</b><br>
- Combines Parliamentary and Presidential features.<br>
- Has both President and Prime Minister.<br>
- President has special powers; PM runs day-to-day government.<br>
- Example: France, Russia.<br>
- Easy way to remember: Two bosses — President for big decisions, PM for daily work.<br>


<b>3. Easy Way to Remember:</b><br>
- Forms = **how constitution is written and power is divided**.<br>
- Models = **how government works and powers are exercised**.<br>

<h1>2.1 – Fundamental Rights: Origin, Purpose and Significance</h1><br><br>

<b>Origin of Fundamental Rights</b><br>
Fundamental Rights in India are inspired mainly by the <b>American Constitution</b>.<br>
They are included in <b>Part III (Articles 12–35)</b> of the Indian Constitution.<br>
They came into force on <b>26 January 1950</b>.<br><br>

<b>Purpose of Fundamental Rights</b><br>
To protect citizens from <b>arbitrary actions (something is based on random choice) of the State</b>.<br>
To ensure <b>liberty, equality, and justice</b>.<br>
To promote the <b>overall development of individuals</b>.<br><br>

<b>Significance of Fundamental Rights</b><br>
They are essential for a <b>democratic system</b>.<br>
They limit the <b>powers of the government</b>.<br>
They are <b>justiciable</b>, meaning they can be enforced in courts.<br>
They make the Constitution a <b>living document</b>.<br><br>

<h1>Article 12 – Definition of State<br></h1><br>
Article 12 defines the term <b>“State”</b> for the purpose of Fundamental Rights.<br><br>

<b>State includes:</b><br>
<b>The Government and Parliament of India</b><br>
<b>The Government and Legislature of States</b><br>
<b>Local authorities</b> (Municipalities, Panchayats)<br>
<b>Other authorities</b> within India or under the control of the Government of India.<br><br>

<b>Concept of State Instrumentalities and Agencies</b><br>
State instrumentalities are bodies that <b>function as an arm of the government</b>.<br>
They may be created by statute or owned/controlled by the government.<br><br>

<b>Examples:</b><br>
LIC, ONGC, BHEL, Airport Authority of India.<br><br>

<b>Tests to identify State instrumentalities (Judicial Interpretation)</b><br>
<b>Financial control</b> by the government.<br>
<b>Administrative control</b> by the government.<br>
Performance of <b>public functions</b>.<br>
Deep and pervasive <b>state control</b>.<br><br>

<h1>Article 13 – Judicial Review </h1><br><br>
Article 13 gives power to courts to <b>review laws</b> and strike down those violating Fundamental Rights.<br><br>

<b>Judicial Review</b><br>
It is the power of courts to <b>declare a law unconstitutional</b> if it violates Fundamental Rights.<br>
Both Supreme Court and High Courts can exercise this power.<br><br>

<b>Pre-Constitutional Laws</b><br>
Laws made <b>before 26 January 1950</b>.<br>
If inconsistent with Fundamental Rights, they become <b>void to the extent of inconsistency</b>.<br><br>

<b>Post-Constitutional Laws</b><br>
Laws made <b>after 26 January 1950</b>.<br>
If they violate Fundamental Rights, they are <b>void from the beginning</b>.<br><br>

<b>Doctrine of Ultra Vires</b><br>
Ultra Vires means <b>“beyond the powers”</b>.<br>
If a law goes beyond the powers given by the Constitution, it is <b>invalid</b>.<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
If Parliament makes a law that violates <b>Fundamental Rights</b>,<br>
the Supreme Court can declare it <b>ultra vires</b> and strike it down.<br><br>

<b>Doctrine of Eclipse</b><br>
Applicable to <b>pre-constitutional laws</b>.<br>
A law inconsistent with Fundamental Rights is <b>not dead</b> but remains <b>inactive</b>.<br>
It becomes active again if the inconsistency is removed.<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
A law made in 1948 restricts <b>freedom of speech</b>.<br>
After 1950, it becomes <b>eclipsed</b> due to Article 19.<br>
If Article 19 is later amended, the old law can become <b>active again</b>.<br><br>

<b>Doctrine of Severability</b><br>
If only a <b>part of a law</b> is unconstitutional, only that part is removed.<br>
The remaining valid part <b>continues to operate</b>.<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
A law has 10 sections.<br>
Section 3 violates a Fundamental Right.<br>
The court strikes down <b>only Section 3</b> and keeps the remaining sections valid.<br><br>

<b>Doctrine of Waiver</b><br>
Waiver means <b>giving up a right</b>.<br>
In India, a person <b>cannot waive Fundamental Rights</b>.<br>
Fundamental Rights are for <b>public interest</b>, not just individual benefit.<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
“I agree not to ask for equal pay, even if I do the same work as others.” <br><br>

<b>Conclusion</b><br>
Fundamental Rights act as the <b>backbone of democracy</b>.<br>
Articles 12 and 13 ensure that the <b>State remains within constitutional limits</b> and protects individual liberty.

<h1>2.2 – Article 14–18: Right to Equality</h1><br><br>

- Practice of untouchability is <b>punishable by law</b>.<br><br>

<b>Article 18 – Abolition of Titles</b><br>
- The State cannot confer any <b>titles</b> except for military or academic distinctions.<br>
- This prevents creating <b>social hierarchies</b> based on titles.<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
- Before independence, some people were called <b>“Raja”</b> or <b>“Sir”</b> by the British.<br>
- After Article 18, such <b>hereditary or honorary titles</b> cannot be legally used in India.<br>
