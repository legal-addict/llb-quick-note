(SMART NOTE)<br>

MODULE 1<br>
1.1 History of Criminal law Difference between civil and criminal law </h1>

<b>History of Criminal Law</b><br><br>

Criminal law deals with offences committed against society and the State.<br>
Its main object is to maintain law and order and punish wrongdoers.<br><br>

<b>Ancient Period</b><br>
In ancient times there were no written criminal laws.<br>
Punishments were based on customs, religion and revenge system.<br>
The principle of “eye for an eye” was followed.<br><br>

<b>Hindu Law Period</b><br>
Criminal law was found in Manusmriti.<br>
Punishment depended upon caste and social status.<br>
King was the supreme authority to administer justice.<br><br>

<b>Muslim Law Period</b><br>
Criminal law was based on Quran and Shariat.<br>
Crimes were classified as Hadd, Qisas and Tazir.<br>
Justice was based on morality and religion.<br><br>

<b>British Period</b><br>
Before British rule there was no uniform criminal law in India.<br>
In 1860 Indian Penal Code was enacted.<br>
It was drafted by Lord Macaulay.<br>
IPC provided uniform definitions and punishments for crimes.<br><br>

<b>Modern Criminal Law</b><br>
Indian Penal Code governed criminal law for many years.<br>
Now it is replaced by Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023.<br>
Modern criminal law focuses on human rights and fair trial.<br><br>

<b>Difference Between Civil Law and Criminal Law</b><br><br>

<b>Civil Law</b><br>
Civil law deals with private disputes between individuals.<br>
Its main object is to provide compensation or relief.<br>
Case is filed by the aggrieved person.<br>
Standard of proof is preponderance (fact of being greater in number)of probabilities.<br>
<b>Example:</b> breach of contract, property dispute.<br><br>

<b>Criminal Law</b><br>
Criminal law deals with offences against society and State.<br>
Its main object is to punish the offender.<br>
Case is prosecuted by the State.<br>
Standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt.<br>
<b>Example:</b> theft, murder, cheating.<br><br>

<b>Conclusion</b><br>
Civil law compensates the victim.<br>
Criminal law punishes the wrongdoer.<br>
Criminal law is stricter in nature to protect society.<br>

<h2>1.2 Concept of Crime, Components of Crime and Criminal Liability </h2>

<b>Concept of Crime</b><br>
A crime is an act or illegal omission (ailure to fulfil a moral or legal obligation.) punishable by law.<br>
A crime is considered a wrong against society and the State.<br>
It creates public harm and disturbs social order.<br>
In criminal law, intention or knowledge of the act is important.<br>
<b>Example</b><br>
If a person steals another person’s mobile phone, it is a crime because it is prohibited by law and punishable by the State.<br><br>


<b>Definition of Crime</b><br>
Crime means any act or omission which is prohibited by law and punishable by the State.<br>
<b>Example:</b> theft, murder, cheating, assault.<br><br>

<b>Components of Crime</b><br>
To constitute a crime, the following two essential elements must be present.<br><br>

<b>1. Actus Reus</b><br>
Actus Reus means the wrongful or prohibited act or omission.<br>
It is the physical conduct of the accused.<br>
A mere intention without action is not punishable.<br>
<b>Example:</b> taking another person’s property dishonestly.<br><br>

<b>2. Mens Rea</b><br>
Mens Rea means a guilty mind or criminal intention.<br>
It shows the mental element behind the act.<br>
Mens Rea includes intention, knowledge, recklessness or negligence.<br>
Without Mens Rea, an act does not usually become a crime.<br>
<b>Example</b><br>
If a person steals a wallet knowing that it belongs to someone else, the guilty intention to steal is Mens Rea.<br><br>

<b>Actus Reus:</b>commit wrongful act <br>
<b>Mens Rea:</b> act with intention <br>
<b>if one of them is missing it'll not call crime</b><br>
<b>Example</b><br>
If a person plans to steal but does not commit the act, there is no crime.<br>
If a person accidentally takes another person’s bag believing it to be his own, there is no Mens Rea, so no crime.<br><br>

<b>Exceptions to Mens Rea</b><br>
In certain offences Mens Rea (intention) is not required.<br>
These are known as strict liability offences.<br>
<b>Example:</b> traffic offences, food adulteration cases.<br><br>

<b>Criminal Liability</b><br>
Criminal liability means legal responsibility for committing a crime.<br>
A person is criminally liable when both Actus Reus(commit) and Mens Rea (intention) are present.<br>
Punishment is imposed by the court for criminal liability.<br><br>

<b>Basis of Criminal Liability</b><br>
The basis of criminal liability is the concurrence of guilty act and guilty mind.<br>
Both must exist at the same time.<br><br>

<b>Exceptions to Criminal Liability</b><br>
Criminal liability may not arise in cases of insanity (irrationality).<br>
Acts done under mistake of fact are exempted (free from an obligation).<br>
Acts done by children below the age of criminal responsibility are exempted.<br>
Acts done in private defence are also exceptions.<br><br>

<b>Conclusion</b><br>
Crime consists of both wrongful act and guilty intention.<br>
Criminal liability arises only when law recognizes the offence.<br>
The aim of criminal law is to punish the offender and protect society.<br>

<h2>1.3 Theories and Kinds of Punishment <br> (Includes IPC Chapter III:  Sections 53 to 75) </h2>

<b>Meaning of Punishment</b><br>
Punishment means penalty imposed by the court on a person who commits a crime.<br>
The main purpose of punishment is to protect society and prevent crimes.<br><br>

<b>Theories of Punishment</b><br><br>

<b>1. Deterrent Theory</b><br>
This theory aims to discourage the offender and others from committing crimes.<br>
Punishment is given to create fear in the minds of people.<br>
<b>Example</b><br>
Punishing a thief with imprisonment discourages others from stealing.<br><br>

<b>2. Preventive Theory</b><br>
This theory prevents the offender from committing further crimes.<br>
The offender is disabled from repeating the offence.<br>
<b>Example</b><br>
Keeping a habitual offender in prison prevents him from committing more crimes.<br><br>

<b>3. Retributive Theory</b><br>
This theory is based on the principle of revenge or retaliation.<br>
The offender is punished because he has committed a wrong.<br>
<b>Example</b><br>
Punishing a murderer because he has caused harm to society.<br><br>

<b>4. Reformative Theory</b><br>
This theory focuses on reforming the offender rather than punishing him harshly.<br>
It believes that criminals can be changed into good citizens.<br>
<b>Example</b><br>
Providing education and training to prisoners to reform their behaviour.<br><br>

<b>5. Expiatory Theory</b><br>
This theory believes punishment cleanses the guilt of the offender.<br>
It is based on moral repentance and atonement.<br>
<b>Example</b><br>
A person feeling guilt and reforming himself after punishment.<br><br>

<b>Kinds of Punishment under IPC (Section 53)</b><br><br>

<b>1. Death Penalty</b><br>
Death penalty is the severest form of punishment.<br>
It is awarded in the rarest of rare cases.<br>
<b>Example</b><br>
Death penalty for heinous offences like brutal murder or terrorism cases.<br><br>

<b>2. Imprisonment for Life</b><br>
Life imprisonment means imprisonment for the remainder of the convict’s natural life.<br>
<b>Example</b><br>
Life imprisonment for murder under IPC.<br><br>

<b>3. Imprisonment</b><br>
Imprisonment may be rigorous or simple.<br>
Rigorous imprisonment involves hard labour.<br>
Simple imprisonment does not involve hard labour.<br>
<b>Example</b><br>
Rigorous imprisonment for robbery and simple imprisonment for minor offences.<br><br>

<b>4. Forfeiture of Property</b><br>
Property of the offender may be confiscated (seize) by the State.<br>
<b>Example</b><br>
Forfeiture of property of a person convicted of serious offences against the State.<br><br>

<b>5. Fine</b><br>
Fine is a monetary penalty imposed by the court.<br>
It may be imposed alone or along with imprisonment.<br>
<b>Example</b><br>
Fine imposed for traffic offences or minor criminal acts.<br><br>

<b>Other Provisions Related to Punishment (Sections 54 to 75)</b><br>
Commutation of sentence allows reduction of punishment.<br>
Solitary (isolating) confinement may be awarded under specific conditions.<br>
Enhanced punishment may be imposed for repeat offenders.<br>
<b>Example</b><br>
Reducing death sentence to life imprisonment under commutation powers.<br>
Higher punishment for a person repeatedly committing the same offence.<br><br>

<b>Conclusion</b><br>
Punishment plays an important role in criminal justice system.<br>
Different theories aim at deterrence, prevention and reformation.<br>
IPC provides various kinds of punishments to maintain law and order.<br>

<h2>1.4 Capital Punishment </h2>

<b>Meaning of Capital Punishment</b><br>
Capital punishment means punishment of death awarded by a court of law.<br>
It is the most severe form of punishment in criminal law.<br>
It is imposed only for the gravest (serious) offences.<br><br>

<b>Purpose of Capital Punishment</b><br>
The purpose is to deter (discourage ) serious crimes and protect society.<br>
It is also based on retribution for heinous offences.<br><br>

<b>Capital Punishment under Indian Law</b><br>
In India, capital punishment is permitted by law.<br>
It is awarded only in the rarest of rare cases.<br>
Courts must give special reasons for awarding death penalty.<br><br>

<b>Rarest of Rare Doctrine</b><br>
The death penalty is imposed only when life imprisonment is not sufficient.<br>
The court considers the nature of crime and the criminal.<br><br>

<b>Example</b><br>
Brutal murder involving extreme cruelty may fall under the rarest of rare cases.<br><br>

<b>Offences Punishable with Death</b><br>
Certain offences provide death penalty as punishment.<br>
These include murder and offences against the State.<br><br>

<b>Example</b><br>
Murder involving brutal violence or terrorism-related offences.<br><br>

<b>Arguments in Favour of Capital Punishment</b><br>
It acts as a strong deterrent against serious crimes.<br>
It delivers justice to victims and society.<br>
It permanently prevents the offender from repeating the crime.<br><br>

<b>Arguments Against Capital Punishment</b><br>
There is a possibility of judicial error.<br>
It violates the right to life and human dignity.<br>
It does not give a chance for reform of the offender.<br><br>

<b>Procedure and Safeguards</b><br>
Death sentence must be confirmed by the High Court.<br>
The accused has the right to appeal and seek mercy petition.<br><br>

<b>Example</b><br>
A convict may file a mercy petition before the President of India.<br><br>

<b>Current Position</b><br>
Capital punishment exists but is rarely awarded.<br>
Indian courts follow strict guidelines while awarding death penalty.<br><br>

<b>Conclusion</b><br>
Capital punishment is an exceptional punishment.<br>
It is imposed only in the rarest of rare cases.<br>
The law aims to balance justice, deterrence and human rights.<br>

<h2>1.5 Stages of Crime</h2>

<b>Meaning of Stages of Crime</b><br>
A crime is not committed suddenly.<br>
It passes through different stages before completion.<br>
Each stage shows the progress of criminal intention into action.<br><br>

<b>Stages of Crime</b><br>
There are four main stages of crime.<br><br>

<b>1. Intention</b><br>
Intention is the first stage of crime.<br>
It means the mental decision to commit a crime.<br>
Intention alone is not punishable under criminal law.<br>
<b>Example</b><br>
A person decides in his mind to steal a bicycle but does nothing further.<br><br>

<b>2. Preparation</b><br>
Preparation means arranging the means to commit the crime.<br>
Generally, preparation is not punishable.<br>
In some serious offences, preparation itself is punishable.<br>
<b>Example</b><br>
A person buys a knife to commit murder.<br><br>

<b>Exceptions where Preparation is Punishable</b><br>
Preparation to wage war against the State is punishable.<br>
Preparation to commit dacoity (violent) is punishable.<br><br>

<b>3. Attempt</b><br>
Attempt is a direct movement towards the commission of the crime.<br>
The offender has done something more than preparation.<br>
Attempt is punishable even if the crime is not completed.<br>
<b>Example</b><br>
A person tries to pick another person’s pocket but fails.<br><br>

<b>4. Commission or Completion</b><br>
This is the final stage where the crime is completed.<br>
The intended offence is fully carried out.<br>
<b>Example</b><br>
A person successfully steals the bicycle.<br><br>

<b>Importance of Stages of Crime</b><br>
They help in determining criminal liability.<br>
They help courts decide the degree of punishment.<br><br>

<b>Conclusion</b><br>
Every crime passes through intention, preparation, attempt and completion.<br>
Punishment depends upon the stage at which the crime is stopped.<br>
Criminal law aims to prevent crimes at the earliest possible stage.<br>

<h2>1.6 Theories of Negligence</h2>

<b>Meaning of Negligence</b><br>
Negligence means failure to take reasonable care which a prudent person would take.<br>
It results in harm or injury to another person.<br>
Negligence may arise due to carelessness or lack of attention.<br>
<b>Example</b><br>
If a driver drives carelessly and hits a pedestrian, it amounts to negligence.<br><br>

<b>Theories of Negligence</b><br><br>

<b>1. Subjective Theory of Negligence</b><br>
This theory considers the personal capacity of the accused.<br>
The conduct of the accused is judged according to his own ability and understanding.<br>
It focuses on the mental condition of the person.<br>
<b>Example</b><br>
A child causing harm is judged differently from an adult because of lesser understanding.<br><br>

<b>2. Objective Theory of Negligence</b><br>
This theory judges negligence based on the conduct of a reasonable person.<br>
Personal capacity of the accused is not considered.<br>
It applies a uniform standard of care for everyone.<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
If a driver breaks traffic rules, he is <b>negligent</b> even if he says he did not know the rule.<br><br>

<b>3. Reasonable Man Theory</b><br>
According to this theory, negligence is determined by comparing conduct with that of a reasonable man.<br>
A reasonable man is a cautious and prudent person.<br>
<b>Example</b><br>
A reasonable person would stop at a red signal.<br>
Failure to stop shows negligence.<br><br>

<b>4. Gross Negligence Theory</b><br>
Gross negligence refers to extreme carelessness.<br>
It shows total disregard for the safety of others.<br>
Criminal liability generally arises in cases of gross negligence.<br>
<b>Example</b><br>
A doctor performing surgery while intoxicated is grossly negligent.<br><br>

<b>Negligence in Criminal Law</b><br>
In criminal law, negligence must be of a high degree to attract punishment.<br>
Simple negligence is usually not punishable.<br>
<b>Example</b><br>
A doctor making a minor mistake is not criminally liable.<br>
But a doctor ignoring basic medical procedures may be criminally liable.<br><br>

<b>Conclusion</b><br>
Negligence is failure to take due care.<br>
Theories of negligence help courts decide liability.<br>
Criminal negligence requires gross or serious negligence.<br>

<h2>2.5 Criminal Conspiracy <br> IPC Chapter V-A: Sections 120 A & B </h2>

<b>Section 120A. Definition of criminal conspiracy</b>: When **two or more persons agree** to commit an illegal act, they are said to have formed a **criminal conspiracy**.<br>
<b>Example:</b> A group plans to rob a bank together.<br>
<b>Punishment:</b> Not punishable by itself; acts committed in furtherance are punishable under 120B<br><br>

<b>Section 120B. Punishment of criminal conspiracy</b>: If a criminal conspiracy **results in the commission of an offence**, all conspirators are **liable for punishment as if they committed the offence themselves**.<br>
<b>Example:</b> If the planned bank robbery is executed, all conspirators can be punished, even if some did not directly participate.<br>
<b>Punishment:</b> Same as punishment for the offence committed in consequence of the conspiracy; can include imprisonment, fine, or both<br><br>

<b>Conclusion – Criminal Conspiracy (Sections 120A & 120B)</b><br><br>
- A <b>criminal conspiracy</b> arises when two or more persons agree to commit an <b>illegal act</b> or a <b>legal act by illegal means</b>.<br>
- <b>Agreement alone</b> is sufficient; actual commission of the crime is not necessary.<br>
- Punishment under <b>Section 120B</b> depends on the intended crime:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Minor crimes → lesser punishment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Serious crimes (death/life) → punishment as prescribed for the offense.<br>
- <b>Key Principle:</b> “Agreement with criminal intent makes all parties liable, even if the act is not completed.”<br><br>


<h2>2.6 Attempts <br> IPC Chapter XXIII: Section 511 </h2>

<b>1. Definition of Attempt (Section 511)</b><br>
- <b>Who it applies to:</b> Anyone who <b>attempts to commit a crime</b> but does not succeed.<br>
- <b>What it says:</b> "Whoever attempts to commit an offense punishable by law but does not succeed, shall be punished as if they had committed the offense, to the extent of the punishment prescribed for attempting it."<br>
- <b>Key:</b> <b>Intention + overt act</b> to commit the crime is enough; success is not required.<br><br>

<b>2. Components of Attempt</b><br>
1. <b>Intention</b>: The person must have the <b>intent to commit a crime</b>.<br>
2. <b>Overt Act</b>: There must be a <b>direct act towards committing the offense</b>. Mere preparation is not enough.<br>
3. <b>Failure or Non-completion</b>: The crime is <b>not successfully completed</b>.<br><br>

<b>Punishment under Section 511 – IPC</b><br><br>

<b>1. General Rule: Lesser Punishment for Attempt</b><br>
- If someone <b>tries to commit a crime but fails</b>, the law usually gives a <b>lighter punishment</b> than if they had succeeded.<br>
- Often, the punishment is <b>half of the maximum punishment</b> for that offense.<br>
- <b>Example:</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Theft (Sec 378) → Maximum punishment 3 years<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Attempted theft → Up to <b>1.5 years</b> (half of 3 years)<br><br>

<b>2. Exception: Serious Crimes (Life or Death)</b><br>
- If the crime attempted is <b>very serious</b> (punishable by <b>life imprisonment or death</b>), the law does <b>not automatically halve the punishment</b>.<br>
- Instead, the attempt is <b>punishable as prescribed in the IPC</b> for attempting that crime.<br>
- <b>Example:</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Attempted murder (Sec 307) → Even if victim survives, punishment can be severe (up to the full extent for attempt)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Attempted murder leading to death → Full murder punishment if death occurs<br><br>

<b>Section 511. Punishment for attempting to commit an offence</b>: A person who **attempts to commit a crime**, but does not succeed, can be punished **as if they committed the offence**, but generally with **lesser severity**.<br>
<b>Example:</b> Trying to break into a house for theft but getting caught before stealing.<br>
<b>Punishment:</b> Imprisonment or fine, **up to half of the maximum punishment** for the actual offence<br><br>

<b>Joint criminal liability in Unlawful Assembly (Sections 141–147)</b>: All members of an **unlawful assembly** are liable for acts committed in **furtherance of the common objective**, even if they did not individually commit the act.<br>
<b>Example:</b> A mob armed with sticks damages property; each member can be punished.<br>
<b>Punishment:</b> As per the offence committed, proportionate to participation<br><br>

<b>Joint criminal liability in Gang Rape (Sections 376D & 34)</b>: When **multiple persons commit rape together**, each is **equally liable** under Section 34 (common intention).<br>
<b>Example:</b> Three persons assault and rape a victim together; all are punished as principals.<br>
<b>Punishment:</b> Life imprisonment, fine, or death penalty in extreme cases<br><br>

<b>Joint criminal liability in Dacoity (Sections 391–395 & 34)</b>: If **five or more persons commit robbery together**, all are liable as **principal offenders**.<br>
<b>Example:</b> A gang of six robs a bank using weapons; even the person who only helps in planning is liable.<br>
<b>Punishment:</b> Rigorous imprisonment for 10 years to life, or fine, as per IPC<br><br>


<b>3. Easy Way to Remember</b><br>
- <b>Minor crimes only attempt(not succeed):</b> Punishment = Usually half of the original crime<br>
- <b>Major crimes (life/death)only attempt(not succeed):</b> Punishment = As prescribed; no automatic reduction

<b>4. Important Points</b><br>
- <b>Mere preparation is not punishable</b>; there must be a clear step towards committing the crime.<br>
- <b>Intention + act = attempt</b><br>
- Applies to <b>all offenses under IPC</b>, unless the law specifically excludes attempts.<br><br>

<b>5. Examples</b><br>
- A points a gun to shoot B but B escapes → Attempt to murder (sec. 307)<br>
- A tries to steal a bike but is caught → Attempt to theft (sec. 511)<br><br>
Overt Act, Success Not Required <br><br>

<b>Conclusion – Attempts (Section 511)</b><br><br>
- An <b>attempt</b> occurs when a person has <b>intention</b> to commit a crime and does an <b>overt act</b> toward it but <b>fails</b> to complete it.<br>
- <b>Success is not required</b>; intention + overt act = punishable attempt.<br>
- Punishment under Section 511:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Minor crimes → usually <b>half of the maximum punishment</b>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Serious crimes (life/death) → punishment as prescribed for the attempted offense.<br>
- <b>Key Principle:</b> “Even an unsuccessful attempt is punishable if the offender intended and acted to commit the crime.”

<h2>1. Unlawful Assembly, Gang Rape and Dacoity from point of view of Joint criminal liability </h2>

<b>1. Basics</b><br>
- <b>Joint criminal liability:</b> When 2 or more persons commit a crime together, all are liable.<br>
- Based on <b>common intention (Sec 34)</b> or <b>common object (Sec 149)</b>.<br><br>

<b>2. Unlawful Assembly (Sec 141)</b><br>
- <b>Definition:</b> 5 or more persons with common object to commit an offense.<br>
- <b>Liability:</b> All members liable for acts done in furtherance of common object.<br>
- <b>Example:</b> 5 people riot, one destroys property → all 5 liable.<br><br>

<b>3. Gang Rape (Sec 376D)</b><br>
- <b>Definition:</b> Sexual assault by 2 or more persons.<br>
- <b>Liability:</b> All participants liable for the entire act under <b>common intention (Sec 34)</b>.<br>
- <b>Example:</b> 3 men assault a woman → all charged with gang rape.<br><br>

<b>4. Dacoity (Sec 391)</b><br>
- <b>Definition:</b> Robbery by 5 or more persons.<br>
- <b>Liability:</b> All members liable for acts done in course of dacoity (<b>common object</b> under Sec 149).<br>
- <b>Example:</b> 6 persons commit dacoity, one kills guard → all 6 liable for murder.<br><br>

<b>Conclusion – Joint Criminal Liability</b><br><br>

- When multiple persons act together to commit a crime, each can be held <b>equally responsible</b> for the acts done in furtherance of the <b>common intention</b> or <b>common object</b>.<br>
- In <b>Unlawful Assembly</b> and <b>Dacoity</b>, liability arises from <b>common object (Sec 149)</b>.<br>
- In <b>Gang Rape</b>, liability arises from <b>common intention (Sec 34)</b>.<br>
- Even a minor participant cannot escape punishment if the act committed was in furtherance of the joint plan.<br>
- <b>Key Principle:</b> “Acting together with a common purpose makes all members responsible, regardless of individual role.”<br>
