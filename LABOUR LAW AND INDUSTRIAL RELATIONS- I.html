MODULE 1: THE TRADE UNIONS ACT, 1926</h1>
<h2>1.1 Evolution and Growth of Trade Union in India</h2>

<b>1. Early Labour Conditions (Pre-1900)</b><br><br>
<b>Before trade unions existed, workers faced:</b><br>
• Long working hours (12–14 hours/day)<br>
• Very low wages<br>

<b>2. Beginning of Labour Movements (1870–1900)</b><br>
• First organised labour strike: Bombay textile workers (1875)<br>
• Important early associations formed<br>

<b>Bombay Mill Hands Association (1890)</b> – First labour organisation<br>
Started by N.M. Lokhande<br><br>

<b>Focus mainly on:</b><br>
• Reduction of working hours<br>
• Weekly holidays<br>

<b>EVOLUTION AND GROWTH OF TRADE UNION IN INDIA</b><br><br>
<b>Trade Unions Act, 1926</b><br>
This Act strengthened and stabilised unions across India <br><br>

<b>7. Growth Phase After 1926 <br></b>
- Many unions registered and became strong <br><br>
<b> Political parties supported unions:</b> <br>
  * Congress → INTUC <br>
  * Communists → CITU<br>
  * Socialists → HMS<br>
  * Others → BMS<br>
- Union membership increased<br>
- More strikes, collective bargaining and negotiations<br><br>

<b>8. Post-Independence Period (1947–1970)</b><br>

<h2>1.2 INTERNATIONAL LABOR ORGANIZATION (ILO) – <br><br>
ITS INFLUENCE IN BRINGING CHANGES IN THE CONSTITUTION 
AND NATIONAL LEGISLATION<br><br></h2>

<b>1. International Labor Organization (ILO)<br></b>
- Founded in 1919 as part of the Treaty of Versailles<br>
- Purpose: To promote social justice and internationally recognized human and labor rights<br><br>

<b>Core Functions:</b><br>
- Setting international labor standards through conventions and recommendations <br>
- Supervising implementation of these standards by member countries<br>
- Providing technical assistance to improve labor conditions<br><br>

<b>India’s Membership:<br></b>
- India became a member in 1919 and has ratified several ILO conventions<br><br>

<b>2. Influence on the Indian Constitution<br></b>
The ILO played a major role in shaping labor-related provisions in the Indian Constitution.<br><br>

<b>Directive Principles of State Policy (guidelines that direct the government to work for the welfare of the people.)(Part IV):<br></b>
- Article 39(a) & (b):<br>
  Ensures that ownership and control of resources serve the common good
  Ensures welfare of workers<br>
  example: <br>
If a factory earns profit, it should also help society by giving jobs and fair prices.<br><br>
- Article 41:<br>
  Provides for the right to work, education, and public assistance in cases of unemployment or old age<br><br>
- Article 43:<br>
  Encourages a living wage, humane working conditions, and workers’ participation in management<br><br>

<b>ILO Influence:</b><br>
- Focus on social justice, fair wages, and safe working conditions mirrors ILO conventions <br><br>

<b>Fundamental Rights (Part III):<br><br></b>
- Article 23:<br>
  Prohibition of forced labor, reflecting ILO Convention No. 29 on Forced Labour (1930)<br><br>
- Article 24:<br>
  Prohibition of child labor under the age of 14, aligned with ILO Convention No. 138 on Minimum Age<br><br>

<b>3. Influence on National Legislation<br><br></b>
India’s labor laws are deeply influenced by ILO standards.<br>

<b></b>Examples:<br></b><br>

<b>Factories Act, 1948<br></b>
- Ensures safe working conditions<br>
- Limits working hours<br>
- Provides leave<br>
- Inspired by ILO conventions on occupational safety and health<br><br>

<b>Minimum Wages Act, 1948 <br></b>
- Guarantees fair wages to workers<br>
- Influenced by ILO advocacy for fair remuneration<br><br>

<b>Industrial Disputes Act, 1947<br></b>
- Regulates dispute resolution between employers and employees<br>
- Echoes ILO’s focus on collective bargaining and dispute settlement<br><br>

<b>Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986<br></b>
- Prohibits employment of children below 14 years<br>
- Directly aligns with ILO conventions on child labor<br><br>
<h2>1.3 DEFINITION, REGISTRATION AND RECOGNITION<br><br></h2>

<b>1. Definition of Trade Union
(According to Section 2(h) of the Trade Unions Act, 1926)<br></b>

A trade union means any combination, whether temporary or permanent,<br><br>
<b>formed primarily for the purpose of regulating the relations between:<br></b>
- Workmen and employers<br>
- Workmen and workmen<br>
- Employers and employers<br>

It also includes federations of trade unions.<br><br>

<b>Key Points:<br></b>
- It must be a combination of workers<br>
- Main purpose is to protect or improve workers’ interests<br>
- Deals with wages, working hours, welfare, and employment conditions<br><br>

<b>2. Registration of Trade Unions<br></b>
- Registration is voluntary under the Trade Unions Act<br>
- A registered union gets legal benefits and protection<br>
- Unregistered unions do not get statutory protection<br><br>

<b>Procedure for Registration:<br></b>
- Application must be made to the Registrar of Trade Unions of the State<br>
- Application must be signed by at least 7 members of the trade union<br><br>

<b>Documents Required:<br></b>
- Rules of the union (objectives, membership rules, office bearers)<br>
- Names, addresses, and occupations of members<br><br>

<b>Certificate of Registration:<br></b>
- Issued by the Registrar<br>
- Gives legal recognition to the trade union<br><br>

<b>Effects of Registration:<br></b>
- Registered union becomes a legal entity<br>
- Can acquire property<br>
- Can enter into contracts<br>
- Can sue and be sued<br>
- Protects members’ interests more effectively<br><br>

<b>3. Recognition of Trade Unions<br></b>

Recognition is different from registration.<br><br>

<b>Meaning:<br></b>
- Recognition means the employer officially accepts a trade union
  as the representative of workers for collective bargaining<br><br>

<b>Key Points:<br></b>
- Usually granted to the union having majority membership<br>
- Recognition allows negotiation on wages, hours, and working conditions<br><br>

<b>Types of Recognition:<br></b>
- Voluntary recognition by employer<br>
- Statutory recognition under labour laws<br>
  (e.g., Industrial Disputes Act, 1947)<br><br>

<b>Effect of Recognition:<br></b>
- Recognized union gets exclusive rights for collective bargaining<br><br>


<h2>1.4 IMMUNITIES IN TRADE DISPUTES: CRIMINAL AND CIVIL <br><br></h2>

<b>1. Concept of Immunity in Trade Disputes<br></b>
- Immunity means protection from legal action<br>
- Available to employees, trade unions, and workers<br>
  when they participate in trade disputes<br><br>

<b>Trade Dispute:<br></b>
- Dispute between employers and employees relating to:<br>
  wages, working conditions, employment terms, or rights<br><br>

<b>Immunity protects workers from:<br></b>
- Criminal liability (e.g., assault, trespass in certain cases)<br>
- Civil liability (e.g., damages for loss caused to employer)<br><br>
<b>2. CRIMINAL IMMUNITY IN TRADE DISPUTES<br></b>

Workers and trade unions are generally immune from criminal liability<br>
for acts done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute,<br>
under certain laws. <br><br>

<b>Key Points:</b><br>
Protected acts may include:<br>
- Strikes<br>
- Picketing<br>
- Refusal to work<br>
- Protest against unfair labour practices<br><br>

<b>Legal Basis (India):<br></b>
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947<br>
- Section 33: Workers are not criminally liable for acts committed
  in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute,
  provided the acts are done in good faith and are not excessive
  or violent.<br><br>

<b>Limits of Criminal Immunity: <br></b>
- Acts of violence<br>
- Damage to property<br>
- Assault or intimidation<br><br>

Such acts will attract criminal liability.<br>
Immunity applies only when the act is directly related to the trade dispute.<br><br>


<b>3. CIVIL IMMUNITY IN TRADE DISPUTES<br></b>

Civil immunity protects workers and trade unions from civil suits,<br>
such as claims for damages by employers.<br><br>

<b>Key Points:<br></b>
Protected acts include:<br>
- Strikes<br>
- Picketing<br>
- Work stoppage<br>
- Collective bargaining actions<br>

<b>Legal Provision:</b>
Under labour laws, no civil liability arises if the act is done
in furtherance of a bona fide trade dispute.<br><br>

<b>Example:<br></b>
Employees going on a legal strike cannot be sued for loss of profits
suffered by the employer.<br><br>

<b>Limits of Civil Immunity:<br>
Civil liability may arise if:<br></b>
- The act is malicious or ultra vires (beyond legal limits)<br>
- Damage caused is unrelated to the trade dispute<br>


<h2>1.5 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING – PURPOSE AND ITS TYPES<br><br></h2>

<b>1. Definition of Collective Bargaining<br></b>

Collective bargaining is a process where employers and employees
(usually represented by trade unions) negotiate terms and conditions
of employment.<br>

- It is a joint discussion to reach mutually acceptable agreements<br>
- It helps maintain industrial harmony in the workplace<br><br>

<b>Key Features:<br></b>
- Between employer and employees (or trade union)<br>
- Focuses on wages, working hours, benefits, and working conditions<br>
- Negotiation results in a collective agreement<br><br>
<b>2. PURPOSE OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING<br><br></b>

<b>The main objectives are:<br></b>

<b>Improve Wages and Benefits<br></b>
- Ensure fair pay, bonuses, medical benefits, allowances<br><br>

<b>Protect Employee Rights<br></b>
- Job security<br>
- Safety<br>
- Grievance redressal<br><br>

<b>Maintain Industrial Harmony<br></b>
- Reduce strikes, lockouts, and industrial unrest<br><br>

<b>Mutual Consultation<br></b>
- Employers understand worker needs<br>
- Workers understand company constraints<br><br>

<b>Increase Productivity<br></b>
- When workers are satisfied, efficiency improves<br><br>


<b>3. TYPES OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING<br></b>

Collective bargaining can be classified based on scope, levels, or subject matter.<br><br>

<b>A. Based on Scope / Level <br></b><br>

<b>Industry-Level Bargaining (Macro-level)<br></b>
- Negotiation covers an entire industry<br>
- Example: Wages of coal miners across the country<br><br>

<b>Enterprise-Level Bargaining (Micro-level)<br></b>
- Negotiation covers a single company or organization<br>
- Example: Working hours or bonuses in a factory<br><br>


<b>B. Based on Nature of Negotiation</b><br><br>

<b>Conjunctive / Distributive Bargaining</b><br>
Distributive bargaining is negotiation where parties divide existing resources, and gain of one is loss of the other.s<br>
<b>example:</b>
Company has limited money. <br>
Workers ask for higher salary. <br>
If salary increases → company profit decreases.<br><br>

<b>Integrative / Interest-based Bargaining<br></b>
- Focuses on mutual gains and problem-solving<br>
- Example: Introducing flexible working hours to benefit both workers and employer<br><br>


<b>C. Based on Subjects<br><br></b>

<b>Wages / Salary Bargaining<br></b>
- Negotiating pay, allowances, overtime<br><br>

<b>Conditions of Work Bargaining<br></b>
- Safety, working hours, leave<br><br>

<b>Union Rights Bargaining<br></b>
- Recognition of union, grievance handling<br><br>


<b>4. BENEFITS OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING<br></b>
- Reduces industrial disputes<br>
- Promotes mutual trust between management and employees<br>
- Ensures fair treatment of employees<br>
- Improves motivation and productivity<br><br>

<h2>MODULE 2<br>
INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES ACT, 1947<br>


1. INDUSTRY – CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS<br><br></h2>


<b>Definition under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947:<br><br></b>

Section 2(j) defines “Industry” as:<br>

“Industry includes any systematic activity carried on by cooperation between employer and employee
for the production, supply, or distribution of goods or services with a view to satisfy human wants or
wishes (whether material or immaterial).”<br><br>

<b>KEY ELEMENTS OF THE DEFINITION</b><br><br>

<b>1. Systematic Activity</b><br>
There must be an organized and continuous activity.<br>
It should not be occasional or casual.<br>
<b>Example:</b> A factory manufacturing textiles is a systematic activity.<br><br>

<b>2. Cooperation between Employer and Employee</b><br>
Both employer and employees must participate.<br>
Solo or self-employed activities do not constitute an industry.<br>
<b>Example:</b> A shop employing workers qualifies, but a single person working alone does not.<br><br>

<b>3. Production, Supply, or Distribution</b><br>
Includes goods and services.<br>
Covers manufacturing and service sectors.<br>
<b>Examples:</b> Banking, education, hospitals, IT services.<br><br>

<b>4. Satisfaction of Human Wants</b><br>
The activity must aim to satisfy human needs.<br>
Needs may be material or immaterial.<br>
<b>Example:</b> Hospitals and hotels satisfy immaterial wants.<br><br>

<b>5. Employer–Employee Relationship</b><br>
Essential requirement of an industry.<br>
Without this relationship, an activity is not an industry.<br><br>

<b>JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION</b><br><br>

<b>Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. v. Their Workmen (1963)</b><br>
Court emphasized cooperation for productive activity as the key element of industry.<br><br>

<b>Bangalore Water Supply v. A. Rajappa (1978)</b><br>
Industry was interpreted in a very broad sense.<br>
Included public utility services like water supply.<br><br>

<b>Dabur India Ltd. Case</b><br>
Service-oriented businesses also qualify as industry.<br>
Employer–employee cooperation is decisive.<br><br>

<h2>2. CONCEPT – INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE<br><br></h2>

<b>Definition (Section 2(k) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947):</b><br>
“Industrial dispute means any dispute or difference between employers and employers,
or between employers and workmen, or between workmen and workmen,
which is connected with employment or non-employment,
terms of employment, or conditions of labor of any person.”<br><br>

<b>KEY ELEMENTS OF INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE</b><br><br>

<b>1. Parties Involved</b><br>
Employer vs Employer<br>
Employer vs Workman<br>
Workman vs Workman<br><br>

<b>2. Subject Matter</b><br>
Employment or non-employment<br>
Terms of employment (wages, hours, leave)<br>
Conditions of labour (safety, discipline, working conditions)<br><br>

<b>Legal Consequence:</b><br>
Industrial disputes may lead to conciliation, arbitration, or adjudication under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.<br><br>

<b>Examples:</b><br>
Workers demanding a wage hike.<br>
Workers protesting unsafe working conditions.<br>
Conflict between two groups of employees in a company.<br><br>

<h2>2. Workman – Concept<br><br></h2>

<b>Definition (Section 2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947):</b><br>

Technical employees<br>
Clerical employees<br>
Operational staff<br><br>

<b>Exclusions:</b><br>

<b>Examples:</b><br>
Factory worker, clerk, technician, driver = <b>Workman</b><br>
Manager, director, CEO = <b>Not a Workman</b><br><br>

<b>3. Employer – Concept</b><br><br>

<b>Definition (Section 2(g) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947):</b><br>
“Employer includes the owner of the industry and any manager, agent, or person responsible for the
management of the industry.”<br><br>

<b>Key Points:</b><br>
Employer is responsible for employment and labour management.<br>
